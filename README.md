# NewsGatewayProject
- Two runnables in separate threads, one to fetch a collection of news sources, which are organized by category.
- Second runnable fetches articles from user selected source.
- Uses services and receivers to handle runnable execution and to 'listen' in a loop on whether to update articles or not.
- uses a Drawer, DrawerList, ViewPager, fragments, etc.
May or may not revisit in the future to make it look nicer, I'd likely use cards or something to clean up the quality of appearance.
